# AssetMasterHub-frontend

This repository contains the frontend code for a corporate asset management website named "**AssetMasterHub**". The code is mainly written by TypeScript and serves as the source code for my course project in the Software Engineering class at Tsinghua University.

The backend code is in https://github.com/fansunqi/AssetMasterHub-backend. The frontend and backend of the project can communicate with each other.
